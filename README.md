This is a CLI advanced matematical solver, in this case, second part of the firts math.io proyect, now with graphical
methods for an easyer analysis of the data.

the graphics of the data were made using pyplot framework, this framework is excelent to this kind of work
it also has a little control panel on the bottom of the grid to control other options.

### What methods can solve?

0-Successive approaches.

1-Biseccion method.

2-Newthon-Rapson method.

3-arithmetic secant.


## How it looks!
